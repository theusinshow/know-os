# KNOW/OS — Autonomous Execution Plan

This file is the durable control surface for the current multi-step implementation task. Keep it current so a new Codex session can resume without asking the user to restate decisions.

Operating protocol: `AUTONOMY.md`.

## Program objective

Deliver the approved KNOW/OS V1 through verified roadmap phases, without collapsing the work into one unstructured pass.

## Current phase

Status: `IN PROGRESS`
Owner: Codex lead agent
Phase: `STEP 14 — GENERATION MODES AND DEEPSEEK PROVIDER`
Autonomy: `HIGH WITH GUARDRAILS`

### Objective

Implement first-release content generation with two modes: Manual Copy and Paste and Direct AI Generation with DeepSeek. Both modes must use the same normalized `GenerationSpec`, prompt compiler, JSON parsing, Pack schema validation, semantic validation, preview/diff and atomic import pipeline. DeepSeek integration must be server-only, provider-abstracted and visibly available even when unconfigured.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Import boundaries include explicit size limits, preview before mutation and conflict reporting for same-version content hash mismatches.
- [x] Export boundaries support explicit Backup, Progress and Teacher Context JSON payloads with category preview and privacy warnings.
- [x] Backup/restore preserves imported content references and owner-scoped user state without mixing content and user data.
- [x] Teacher-context export includes selected lesson, mastery evidence, recent attempts, mistakes, review queue and projects.
- [x] Accessibility audit covers keyboard paths, landmarks, focus states, status messaging and responsive behavior for implemented V1 routes.
- [x] Security audit covers learner-code isolation, secret redaction, export privacy, import validation and production deployment readiness notes.
- [x] Owner authentication/deployment preparation is documented or implemented only within approved local scope; external deployment remains blocked pending user confirmation.
- [x] Unit, integration, component and E2E coverage includes import conflict handling, export/restore behavior and audit-relevant smoke paths.
- [x] Documentation, changelog, `PROJECT_STATUS.md` and this plan reflect Phase 6 behavior.

### Step 13 acceptance criteria

- [x] App shell follows the approved technical-brutalist window/chrome direction with stronger topbar/sidebar/status separation.
- [x] Primary navigation marks the current route instead of leaving `Fundação` selected on every screen.
- [x] Shared page shells, module sections, lists, progress summaries, import/restore panels and auth status blocks use visible borders, backgrounds and solid shadows to separate information hierarchy.
- [x] UI changes reuse generated design tokens and official `public/branding` assets; no Design System source files are modified.
- [x] Motion remains state-driven, short and compatible with `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- [x] Lint, typecheck, tests, build and focused Playwright visual/accessibility smoke pass locally.

### Step 14 acceptance criteria

- [x] `/import` or a dedicated generation surface exposes a mode selector with `MANUAL / COPY AND PASTE` and `AI / DEEPSEEK`.
- [x] Manual mode is fully functional: Configure -> Compile Prompt -> Copy Prompt -> Paste AI JSON -> Validate -> Preview -> Import.
- [x] A persisted `GenerationJob` survives the manual waiting state with status `waiting_external_response`.
- [ ] DeepSeek mode has complete UI, domain contract, configuration detection and provider adapter; the card remains visible as `UNCONFIGURED` when `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is absent.
- [x] Server env supports `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL`, `DEEPSEEK_DEFAULT_MODEL`, `DEEPSEEK_PRO_MODEL` without exposing secrets to client code.
- [ ] Provider abstraction includes `ManualGenerationProvider` and `DeepSeekGenerationProvider`; app code outside the adapter does not import DeepSeek/OpenAI-compatible client specifics directly.
- [x] DeepSeek defaults to `deepseek-v4-flash`, supports advanced `deepseek-v4-pro`, and never uses retired `deepseek-chat` or `deepseek-reasoner`.
- [x] DeepSeek requests execute only from server-only modules, use `response_format: { type: "json_object" }`, explicitly request JSON, include a compact JSON example, require `caderno.lesson.v1`, prohibit Markdown outside JSON and default Thinking Mode off.
- [x] Empty or transient provider failures retry once; authentication, insufficient balance and deterministic validation errors do not retry automatically.
- [ ] Failure UI preserves `GenerationSpec` and compiled prompt and offers Retry, Switch to Manual, Copy Prompt and View Technical Details.
- [x] Generation statuses include: `draft`, `compiled`, `waiting_external_response`, `ready`, `generating`, `receiving`, `validating`, `repairing`, `ready_to_import`, `invalid`, `rate_limited`, `insufficient_balance`, `timeout`, `failed`, `imported`.
- [x] Provider usage is persisted when returned with model, input tokens, output tokens, cache-hit tokens, estimated cost and timestamp; pricing lives in one versioned configuration module and UI labels cost as an estimate.
- [x] Manual and DeepSeek outputs use exactly the same parser, schema validator, business validator, preview, diff and atomic importer. No raw model response can be imported directly.
- [ ] Required tests cover unconfigured DeepSeek, client secret isolation, model defaults, mode switching state preservation, valid/invalid DeepSeek JSON validation, empty-response retry, auth failure no-retry, failure-to-manual fallback, usage persistence and import bypass prevention.

### Post-V1 hardening increments

- [x] 4.1 Real PostgreSQL validation harness.
  - Add a guarded script that loads a real PostgreSQL URL from `TEST_DATABASE_URL` or ignored local env, creates a uniquely named disposable schema, applies checked-in SQL migrations inside that schema, runs a minimal Track Pack import/read/RUN/SUBMIT/progress smoke, and drops only that schema in cleanup.
  - The script must redact connection strings, refuse `memory://local`, avoid production `public` schema, and report exact counts/results.
  - Added `pnpm test:postgres`, `scripts/run-real-postgres-test.mjs` and `tests/integration/real-postgres.test.ts`.
  - The normal `pnpm test` suite skips the real PostgreSQL test unless the runner sets `KNOW_OS_RUN_REAL_POSTGRES_TESTS=1`.
  - The harness creates and drops only a validated `know_os_real_pg_*` schema. It discovered that generated Drizzle foreign keys in existing migrations qualify references as `"public".*`; the isolated harness rebinds those references to the disposable schema at runtime without modifying migration files or production tables.
- [x] 4.2 Real PostgreSQL validation gate.
  - Run the new validation against the configured PostgreSQL service when a URL is available.
  - Record exact results and keep production application data untouched.
  - `pnpm test:postgres` passed against the configured real PostgreSQL URL from ignored local environment using a disposable schema. Validation covered 7 migrations, 1 imported track, 2 activities, RUN with 0 attempts and SUBMIT with 1 attempt plus progress assertions.
- [x] 5.1 Dependency vulnerability scanning.
  - Add dependency vulnerability scanning command/documentation.
  - Added `pnpm security:audit` for production/runtime dependencies.
  - Added pnpm overrides for patched transitive production dependencies: `sharp@0.35.0`, `postcss@8.5.18` and `esbuild@0.25.12`.
  - Kept the full dev audit residual explicit: `eslint -> minimatch@3 -> brace-expansion`; `brace-expansion@1.1.18` is pinned for compatibility, while forcing `brace-expansion@5` breaks ESLint.
- [x] 5.2 CSP candidate and header coverage.
  - Define and test a production CSP candidate without breaking current Auth.js/Google/Vercel behavior.
  - Added an enforced CSP candidate to `next.config.ts` covering default/base/frame/object/form/script/style/img/font/connect/frame/worker/manifest directives.
  - Extended Playwright security-header coverage for CSP directives and Google OAuth origin allowance.
- [x] 5.3 Security validation gate.
  - Run dependency audit, lint, typecheck, unit tests, focused security-header E2E and build.
  - Record exact results and checkpoint.
  - Gate passed with production audit clean, lint/typecheck/test/security-header E2E/build passing.
- [x] 6.1 Pack distribution catalog.
  - Consolidate Pack versioning/distribution rules before public content publication.
  - Added `packs/catalog.json` with the published example Track Pack, canonical content hash and compatibility metadata.
  - Documented the immutable `schema:packId:version` publication tuple in `docs/11-PACK-SPEC.md` and `packs/README.md`.
- [x] 6.2 Pack compatibility verification.
  - Add compatibility fixtures/tests for accepted Pack versions.
  - Added `pnpm packs:verify` and `scripts/verify-pack-catalog.mjs` to validate catalog entries, paths, metadata, canonical hashes and compatibility.
  - Extended `tests/unit/track-pack-validation.test.ts` to assert the catalog entry matches the accepted `caderno.track.v1` fixture hash.
- [x] 6.3 Pack publication validation gate.
  - Run Pack verification, focused unit tests, lint, typecheck and build.
  - Record exact results and checkpoint.
  - Gate passed with Pack verification, focused unit tests, lint, typecheck, production audit, full tests and build.
- [x] 7.1 Persisted gamification schema.
  - Add `badge_awards`, `mission_progress` and append-only mission progress audit records with owner scope and generated migration.
  - Added `badge_awards`, `mission_progress`, `mission_progress_events` and generated `src/db/migrations/0007_icy_vengeance.sql`.
- [x] 7.2 Gamification projection repository.
  - Materialize earned badge awards once, upsert current mission progress and append mission status-change events from deterministic rule output.
  - Keep XP, review, mistakes and mastery as the inputs; do not let persisted gamification change domain decisions.
  - Added PostgreSQL and memory repositories for deterministic gamification projection sync.
- [x] 7.3 Product and export readback.
  - Surface persisted award/progress timestamps on `/achievements`.
  - Include gamification projection data in export snapshots without enabling automatic user-state replay.
  - `/achievements` displays persisted badge/progress timestamps when available.
  - Backup and Progress exports include gamification projection data; restore V1 still skips gamification replay with other user-state categories.
- [x] 7.4 Gamification persistence validation gate.
  - Run focused unit/integration tests, migration generation, lint, typecheck, full tests, build and diff check before checkpoint.
  - Gate passed with migration generation, focused tests, lint, typecheck, full tests, production audit, build and diff check.
- [x] 8.1 User-state restore policy ADR.
  - Design the conflict-safe append-only replay/merge policy before implementing restore of attempts, XP, history, mistakes or review state.
  - Define identity mapping, idempotency keys, conflict classes, blocked cases and acceptable append-only merge behavior.
  - Added ADR 0016 for `user_state_dry_run`, future `user_state_apply`, restore provenance ledger, append-only categories, projection handling and blocking conflicts.
- [x] 8.2 Restore contract documentation.
  - Update import/export/restore docs with explicit V1 restore modes: Pack-only apply, dry-run user-state replay plan and future apply gate.
  - Keep automatic replay disabled until compatibility tests and UI review exist.
  - Updated import/export docs, README, data model notes and changelog.
- [x] 8.3 Restore policy validation gate.
  - Run documentation-relevant type/test checks and diff check.
  - Gate passed with lint, typecheck and diff check.
- [x] 9.1 Restore provenance schema.
  - Add owner-scoped `restore_provenance` ledger with source export fingerprint, source record identity, local record identity and payload hash.
  - Added `restore_provenance`, generated `src/db/migrations/0008_pale_shiver_man.sql` and added the read repository foundation.
- [x] 9.2 Dry-run planner contract.
  - Extend restore preview with `know-os.user-state-restore-dry-run.v1`, stable Backup fingerprint, category plans, warnings and blockers.
  - Keep `applyEnabled=false`; do not import attempts, XP, history, mistakes, reviews or gamification projections.
  - Restore preview now includes a blocked dry-run user-state plan and stable canonical Backup fingerprint.
- [x] 9.3 Dry-run validation gate.
  - Run migration generation, focused restore/import tests, lint, typecheck, full tests, build and diff check.
  - Gate passed with migration generation, focused tests, lint, typecheck, full tests, production audit, build and diff check.
- [x] 10.1 Restore dry-run UI.
  - Add a `/exports` restore preview panel that posts Backup JSON to `/api/restore/preview`.
  - Display categories, source fingerprint, blocked apply state and user-state dry-run blockers.
  - Added `RestorePreviewPanel` to `/exports` with textarea input, status region, dry-run summary, category plan and blocker readout.
- [x] 10.2 Restore compatibility coverage.
  - Add component coverage for the UI and contract coverage for missing Pack manifest blockers.
  - Keep user-state apply unavailable.
  - Added component test for the blocked dry-run UI and contract test for state without Pack manifests.
- [x] 10.3 Restore UI validation gate.
  - Run focused component/unit tests, lint, typecheck, full tests, build and diff check.
  - Gate passed with focused tests, lint, typecheck, full tests, production audit, build and diff check.
- [x] 11.1 CSP nonce builder and proxy application.
  - Move CSP construction into a tested shared module.
  - Generate a per-request nonce in the Next.js 16 `src/proxy.ts` guard, set `x-nonce` for dynamic rendering and attach the matching CSP header to runtime responses.
  - Remove production `script-src 'unsafe-inline'`; allow `unsafe-eval` only outside production if required by the local Next.js dev server.
- [x] 11.2 Header coverage.
  - Extend unit and Playwright coverage to assert nonce-bearing CSP behavior and preserved Google OAuth origins.
  - Confirm security headers remain present on protected redirects and public runtime pages.
- [x] 11.3 CSP hardening validation gate.
  - Run focused security tests, lint, typecheck, build, security audit and diff check before checkpoint.
  - Gate passed with focused CSP unit tests, lint, typecheck, build, focused Playwright security-header smoke, production audit and full tests.
- [x] 12.1 Authenticated read-only walkthrough.
  - Use an existing owner browser session when available.
  - Validate protected production pages without clicking RUN, SUBMIT SOLUTION, restore apply or other mutating actions.
  - Chrome owner session reached the protected home page and validated `/`, `/tracks`, `/tracks/javascript`, `/lessons/js-fundamentals-001`, `/import`, `/progress` and `/knowledge-map`.
- [x] 12.2 Production CSP readback.
  - Confirm the live production deployment emits nonce-bearing CSP after the Step 11 push.
  - `https://know-os.vercel.app/` returned `Content-Security-Policy` with `script-src 'self' 'nonce-*' 'strict-dynamic'` and no production `unsafe-inline`/`unsafe-eval`.
- [ ] 12.3 Production schema repair gate.
  - `/exports` and `/achievements` currently fail in authenticated production with Server Components render errors.
  - Likely cause: Neon production schema has not applied checked-in migrations `0007_icy_vengeance.sql` and `0008_pale_shiver_man.sql`.
  - Stop for explicit user confirmation before running `pnpm db:migrate` against Neon production because it is an external database schema write.
- [x] 13.1 Global UI alignment implementation.
  - Compare `design-system/uploads` and `design-system/KNOW-OS.dc.html` against current app shell/pages.
  - Update shared layout/CSS primitives so all routes inherit the same section, panel, list and status hierarchy.
  - Keep product behavior unchanged and avoid fake unfinished product screens.
- [x] 13.2 UI alignment validation gate.
  - Run lint, typecheck, unit tests, build, focused Playwright smoke and local screenshot capture.
  - Update durable status/changelog and checkpoint/push when the gate passes.
  - Implemented, checkpointed and pushed as `81f4ce3`.
- [x] 14.0 Deep orientation.
  - Read/update: `docs/11-PACK-SPEC.md`, `docs/13-IMPORT-EXPORT.md`, `docs/16-SECURITY-ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/20-ACCEPTANCE-CRITERIA.md`, `docs/22-API-CONVENTIONS.md`, `docs/23-ERROR-HANDLING.md`, ADR 0010 and applicable import/domain files.
  - Confirm whether generation imports `caderno.lesson.v1` directly or wraps validated Lesson Packs into an atomic Track/Module import boundary; if this is a durable Pack-pipeline choice, create an ADR.
  - Orientation completed on 2026-07-31. Generation output will target `caderno.lesson.v1` as the normalized model/manual artifact, but raw output remains blocked from import until the shared parser, schema validator, business validator, preview/diff and atomic importer are implemented in later Step 14 increments. No ADR is required for 14.0/14.1 because no Pack schema or import behavior changes in this increment.
- [x] 14.1 Generation contracts and environment.
  - Create/update: `src/features/generation/**`, `src/lib/env.ts`, `.env.example`, tests/unit env/provider readiness tests.
  - Define `GenerationSpec`, `GenerationStatus`, provider-independent request/result/errors, prompt compiler and server-only provider interface.
  - Add DeepSeek configuration detection with defaults: base URL `https://api.deepseek.com`, default model `deepseek-v4-flash`, pro model `deepseek-v4-pro`.
  - Implemented generation contracts, provider-independent prompt compilation, raw JSON parser, server-only DeepSeek readiness detection, env defaults and model-alias rejection. Added `server-only` as an explicit runtime guard dependency.
- [x] 14.2 Persistence foundation.
  - Create/update: `src/db/schema/user-state.ts`, `src/db/repositories/generation-job-repository.ts`, memory repository, generated migration and integration tests.
  - Persist `GenerationJob`, selected mode/model, normalized spec, compiled prompt, status timeline, raw response metadata hash where safe, validation result references and provider usage estimates.
  - Never persist API keys, client secrets or unredacted provider credentials.
  - Implemented owner-scoped `generation_jobs`, Drizzle and memory repositories, status timeline persistence, compiled prompt/spec storage and provider usage storage. Generated `0009_volatile_captain_britain.sql`.
- [x] 14.3 Lesson Pack parser and shared validation pipeline.
  - Create/update: lesson Pack schema/semantic validator under `src/features/import/application/**` or a new Pack-validation module, plus fixtures/tests.
  - Add `caderno.lesson.v1` parser and semantic validation, then route manual/DeepSeek outputs into the same preview/diff/import path.
  - Ensure unsupported schema versions, malformed JSON and business-rule failures are blocked before preview/import.
  - Implemented `lessonPackSchema`, `validateLessonPack`, generated-output validation, malformed/Markdown blocking and Track Pack wrapping only after validated Lesson Pack JSON.
- [x] 14.4 Manual generation product flow.
  - Create/update: generation UI components and server actions/API routes.
  - Implement Configure -> Compile Prompt -> Copy Prompt -> Paste AI JSON -> Validate -> Preview -> Import with `waiting_external_response` persistence.
  - Preserve form data when switching modes.
  - Implemented `/import` mode selector, Manual Copy/Paste flow, DeepSeek readiness panel, compile/validate/import API routes and E2E coverage. Manual import rebuilds a validated Track Pack boundary before calling the existing atomic importer.
- [x] 14.5 DeepSeek provider adapter.
  - Create/update: `src/features/generation/infrastructure/deepseek-generation-provider.server.ts`, provider tests and request handler.
  - Use the OpenAI-compatible DeepSeek API from server-only code, `response_format: { type: "json_object" }`, timeout/cancellation support, one retry for empty/transient responses and no retry for auth/balance/validation failures.
  - Map errors to `invalid`, `rate_limited`, `insufficient_balance`, `timeout` and `failed` statuses with technical details available without exposing secrets.
  - Implemented server-only `DeepSeekGenerationProvider`, `/api/generation/deepseek/generate`, JSON-only OpenAI-compatible request construction, one retry for empty/transient/timeout results, non-retry auth/balance/rate handling and UI action wiring while preserving Manual form state across mode switches.
- [x] 14.6 Usage/cost estimates.
  - Create/update: versioned pricing config module and usage persistence/read models.
  - Persist provider usage when returned and label estimated cost as an estimate everywhere in UI/API.
  - Implemented `src/features/generation/pricing.ts` with official DeepSeek model pricing captured as `deepseek-api-pricing-2026-07-31`, provider-side cost estimation, persisted `pricingVersion` metadata and a DeepSeek preview callout that labels the USD value as estimated.
- [ ] 14.7 Failure recovery UI.
  - Add Retry, Switch to Manual, Copy Prompt and View Technical Details actions for failed generation without losing `GenerationSpec` or compiled prompt.
  - Keep DeepSeek mode visible while unconfigured and disable only the direct generation action.
- [ ] 14.8 Generation validation gate.
  - Run focused unit/component/integration tests for generation, import validation reuse and provider behavior.
  - Run `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, focused Playwright generation smoke and `git diff --check`.
  - Checkpoint locally and ask before push/deployment.

### Assumptions

- Phase 6 may harden existing `caderno.track.v1` import behavior without changing the Pack schema namespace.
- Export/restore can use JSON payloads in V1; a `.caderno` binary container remains future work unless required by tests/specs.
- Production deployment is preparation only. Any external write, publish or deployment requires user confirmation.
- Owner authentication requires a durable provider decision if it goes beyond local-only preparation; create an ADR or stop for confirmation when needed.
- Content/user-state separation, append-only attempts/evidence/events/XP and RUN/SUBMIT boundaries remain non-negotiable.
- `memory://local` remains a disposable E2E harness; Drizzle/PGlite tests continue to cover migration-backed repository behavior.
- Production stack is now user-approved as Vercel + Neon Postgres + Auth.js Google OAuth.
- No Vercel project, Neon database, Google OAuth credential, secret, deployment or external configuration may be created without a separate user confirmation.

### Production readiness increments

- [x] 2.1 Choose production stack.
  - Accepted stack: Vercel hosting, Neon Postgres, Auth.js with Google OAuth.
- [x] 2.2 Record production stack ADR.
  - Added ADR 0015 for Vercel + Neon + Google OAuth, single-owner e-mail allowlist and owner mapping.
- [x] 2.3 Environment contract.
  - Update `.env.example`, `src/lib/env.ts`, deployment docs and tests for `AUTH_SECRET`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`, `KNOW_OS_ALLOWED_GOOGLE_EMAILS`, `APP_URL`, `DATABASE_URL` and `KNOW_OS_OWNER_ID`.
  - Implemented optional local auth env parsing, Google e-mail allowlist parsing, `.env.example` placeholders and README/deployment docs.
- [x] 2.4 Auth foundation.
  - Add Auth.js dependencies, Google provider route and server auth helpers.
  - Installed `next-auth@5.0.0-beta.32`, added `src/auth.ts`, `/api/auth/[...nextauth]` and auth readiness helpers/tests.
- [x] 2.5 Owner resolution and route/API protection.
  - Map allowed Google account to `KNOW_OS_OWNER_ID`; protect user-state pages and private/mutating APIs in production mode.
  - Added central middleware guard: local mode stays open when Google auth is absent; configured Google OAuth mode requires an allowed session for private pages and APIs.
- [x] 2.6 Neon migration/deployment runbook.
  - Document Neon/Vercel setup, migration command path and health-check expectations without committing secrets.
  - Added `pnpm db:migrate`, migration README notes and `docs/28-PRODUCTION-RUNBOOK.md`.
- [x] 2.7 Validation, commit and push.
  - Validation gate passed and Step 2 production-readiness commits were pushed to GitHub.
- [x] 2.8 Production OAuth sign-in repair.
  - Custom sign-in page was already live; production Google OAuth returned `invalid_client`.
  - Re-applied Vercel Production `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `APP_URL` and `AUTH_TRUST_HOST` from ignored local environment values without printing secrets.
  - Redeployed production and verified Google opens with `prompt=select_account` and without `invalid_client`.
- [x] 2.9 Design-system motion pass.
  - Apply the approved Design System motion tokens to app shell, sign-in and recurring content primitives.
  - Add state feedback for hover, focus, active, reveals and status changes without continuous decorative animation.
  - Preserve `prefers-reduced-motion`, focus visibility and the technical-brutalist visual direction.
  - Validated lint, typecheck, build, focused Playwright motion/accessibility/auth smoke and local screenshot capture before push/deployment.
- [x] 3.1 Product import activation.
  - Add a real `/import` product surface for Track Pack JSON instead of instructing users to call `POST /api/import/track`.
  - Support loading the bundled example Pack, paste/file JSON input, server preview, conflict/error feedback and apply-only-after-valid-preview behavior.
  - Link empty Today/Tracks states and primary navigation to the import flow.
- [x] 3.2 Production import and vertical-slice validation.
  - Deploy the `/import` product surface.
  - Use the protected production UI/API to import the bundled JavaScript example Pack.
  - Validate `/tracks`, `/tracks/javascript`, `/lessons/js-fundamentals-001`, RUN/SUBMIT behavior and `/exports` after import.
  - Record exact production smoke results, checkpoint and continue.
  - Deployed commit `7e9246f` to production deployment `dpl_6DevBvMk8iDgmw1PBroFEHnaGwW8`, aliased to `https://know-os.vercel.app`.
  - Confirmed unauthenticated production protection: `/import` and `/tracks` redirect to `/auth/signin`; `/api/import/track/example` returns `401`; `/api/health/db` returns `200`.
  - Imported `know-os.javascript-fundamentals` version `1` into Neon through the production service boundary.
  - Validated the production vertical slice at service level: catalog read returns `tracks=1`, `track=javascript`, `lesson=js-fundamentals-001`, `activities=2`; `RUN` completed without creating attempts; `SUBMIT SOLUTION` passed both activities; lesson progress is `2/2`; track progress is `1/1`; export kinds are `backup`, `progress` and `teacher_context`.
  - Browser-session UI validation remains user-operated because the agent does not have the owner's authenticated Google browser session in this environment.

### Planned increments

- [x] 6.1 Orient from portability, Pack, import/export, security and deployment docs.
  - Read/update context: `docs/11-PACK-SPEC.md`, `docs/13-IMPORT-EXPORT.md`, `docs/16-SECURITY-ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/18-DEPLOYMENT.md`, `docs/20-ACCEPTANCE-CRITERIA.md`, `docs/22-API-CONVENTIONS.md`, `docs/23-ERROR-HANDLING.md`, design-system accessibility/responsive docs and applicable ADRs.
  - Confirm which owner-auth/deployment-prep work is local-only and which requires a stop condition.
  - Read Pack/import-export/security/API/error/accessibility/responsive sources. `docs/18-DEPLOYMENT.md` is missing and must be created during deployment preparation; no production deployment is authorized.
- [x] 6.2 Import hardening.
  - Create/update: `src/features/import/**`, `src/app/api/import/track/route.ts`, import tests.
  - Add payload size limit, preview/diff output and same-version conflict reporting without mutating data.
  - Implemented `readJsonRequestWithLimit`, `previewTrackPack`, `/api/import/track/preview`, hash diff metadata and import request tests.
- [x] 6.3 Export contracts.
  - Create/update: `src/features/export/**`, export schemas, API routes/pages and tests.
  - Support Backup, Progress and Teacher Context previews with explicit included categories and privacy warnings.
  - Implemented export snapshot repositories, `know-os.export.v1` contract builders, `/exports`, `/api/export/preview` and `/api/export`.
- [x] 6.4 Restore path.
  - Create/update: restore validation/application service, repository tests and recovery UI/API as needed.
  - Preserve user state/content separation and append-only history semantics.
  - Implemented `previewRestore`, `/api/restore/preview`, manifest-backed Backup payloads and `/api/restore` content Pack application. User-state categories are preserved in the Backup payload and reported during non-destructive restore; ADR 0014 keeps append-only user-state replay out of V1 restore.
- [x] 6.5 Accessibility and responsive audit.
  - Create/update: component/E2E coverage and docs for keyboard/focus/status/responsive checks across V1 routes.
  - Added `tests/e2e/accessibility.spec.ts` and `docs/25-ACCESSIBILITY-AND-RESPONSIVE-AUDIT.md`; full E2E now runs serially because the disposable `memory://local` harness is process-global.
- [x] 6.6 Security and deployment preparation.
  - Create/update: security audit doc, deployment readiness doc/config, owner-auth ADR or local-only implementation if in scope.
  - Do not deploy, publish or configure real external services.
  - Added baseline security headers, `tests/e2e/security-headers.spec.ts`, `docs/26-SECURITY-AUDIT.md`, `docs/27-DEPLOYMENT-PREPARATION.md`, ADR 0013 and ADR 0014.
- [x] 6.7 Documentation, full verification and V1 completion gate.
  - Update: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `PLANS.md`, relevant docs.
  - Required commands: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm test:e2e`.
  - Completed final V1 gate. Checkpoint commit unavailable because this checkout has no `.git/` directory.

### Phase gate

After every Phase 6 acceptance criterion passes:

1. update `PROJECT_STATUS.md`;
2. record verification results below;
3. create a local checkpoint commit when safe and available;
4. mark the active goal complete when V1 is genuinely handled;
5. stop for user confirmation before any deployment, publishing, external write or provider decision.

## Roadmap continuation

The lead agent may continue Phase 1 through Phase 6 autonomously, one verified phase at a time. Every phase requires:

- explicit objective and acceptance criteria;
- file-level increments;
- narrow checks after each increment;
- full phase-gate validation;
- updated documentation and project status;
- a local checkpoint when available;
- a resumable `NEXT ACTION`.

Do not implement deferred public-product features.

## Decisions needed during execution

Record durable decisions in `docs/ADR/`. Do not silently choose an authentication provider, hosted database, runtime engine, deployment vendor, billing system, or marketplace design.

Reversible implementation details may be chosen and documented without pausing.

## Verification log

Add timestamped commands and exact outcomes during implementation.

2026-07-30 BRT — pnpm exec vitest run tests/integration/real-postgres.test.ts without the real-Postgres flag — passed with 1 skipped file/test; normal test suite does not access external PostgreSQL.
2026-07-30 BRT — pnpm typecheck after adding real PostgreSQL harness — passed.

## Blockers

```text
No real local PostgreSQL service is available outside `.env.local`; `pnpm test:postgres` validates the configured PostgreSQL service through a disposable schema and production database writes must remain non-destructive and explicitly scoped.
Authenticated Chrome walkthrough is available, but `/exports` and `/achievements` fail in production with Server Components render errors after Step 11 deployment. The likely repair is applying checked-in migrations `0007_icy_vengeance.sql` and `0008_pale_shiver_man.sql` to Neon production with `pnpm db:migrate`, which requires explicit user confirmation as an external database schema write.
Step 13 UI alignment has been checkpointed and pushed as `81f4ce3`.
Step 14.0 through 14.6 are implemented locally and fully validated. No DeepSeek credentials should be requested or exposed; use an unconfigured provider state unless the user configures `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in ignored server environment.
```

## NEXT ACTION

Continue Step 14 with increment 14.7: add Retry, Switch to Manual, Copy Prompt and View Technical Details actions for failed generation without losing `GenerationSpec` or compiled prompt. Keep the separate Neon production migration blocker untouched until explicit confirmation.

## Rules

- A feature owns its UI, application logic and internal adapters.
- Shared UI primitives contain no product-specific business rules.
- `lib/` is not a dumping ground; helpers require a clear infrastructure purpose.
- Domain rules avoid framework imports where practical.
- Database schema is grouped by domain but migrates as one application.
- Generated token CSS lives in a clearly named generated path.
- Runtime worker code has a nested `AGENTS.md` when implementation begins because its security rules are stricter.

## Current placeholder folders

Empty folders contain README files explaining their intended role. Codex may restructure them during Phase 0 if it records the final structure and preserves the modular boundaries.

# KNOW/OS — Project Status

Last updated: 2026-08-04

## Current phase

`STEP 15 READY FOR REVIEW — FIRST-RUN, MOBILE STUDY FLOW AND VISUAL ROUTING`

Phase 0 repository foundation is implemented and verified. The repository now contains a Next.js App Router scaffold with TypeScript strict mode, Tailwind/token generation, minimal accessible shell, Drizzle/PostgreSQL foundation, Zod validation, Vitest/Testing Library/Playwright smoke tests and GitHub Actions CI.

Phase 1 first vertical slice is implemented and verified: import Track Pack, browse Track and Lesson, open JavaScript activity, RUN code, SUBMIT solution, record Attempt, update simple progress and show History event.

Phase 2 learning core is implemented and verified: concept read models/pages, lesson block renderers, activity registry routing, persisted latest attempt feedback and navigation progress summaries.

Phase 3 programming lab is implemented and verified: explicit runtime contracts, clearer terminal/test feedback, display-only attempt diffs and a first debug activity path.

Phase 4 mastery, review and mistakes is implemented and verified.

Phase 5 projects and gamification is implemented and verified. The implemented surface includes optional project contexts, append-only XP, transparent ranks/badges/missions, an accessible knowledge map and project-aware Today recommendations.

Phase 6 portability and hardening is implemented and verified. The V1 local product now includes import preview/hardening, Backup/Progress/Teacher Context exports, non-destructive Backup restore for Pack manifests, accessibility/responsive audit coverage, baseline security headers, security audit documentation and deployment preparation within local-only guardrails.

Production deployment is live at `https://know-os.vercel.app` using the ADR 0015 stack: Vercel, Neon Postgres and Auth.js Google OAuth. Step 2 implementation includes the Auth.js Google foundation, production environment contract, central session guard and Neon/Vercel runbook. Neon migrations have been applied and unauthenticated production smoke checks pass. The sign-in surface now uses the custom `/auth/signin` page following the KNOW/OS Design System, and Google OAuth requests include `prompt=select_account` so account selection is explicit. After a Google `invalid_client` response, Vercel Production OAuth/Auth environment values were re-applied from ignored local values, production was redeployed and the Google page was verified without `invalid_client`. A design-system motion pass now applies approved short motion tokens to app shell, sign-in and recurring content primitives while preserving reduced-motion behavior. Step 3 adds a real `/import` product surface for example/paste/file Track Pack activation with preview-before-apply semantics, deploys it to production and validates the first production learning loop at service level. Step 4 adds and runs guarded real-PostgreSQL validation through a disposable schema, covering checked-in migrations plus import/RUN/SUBMIT/progress behavior without touching production application tables. Step 5 adds production dependency vulnerability scanning, patched transitive runtime overrides and an enforced CSP candidate with Playwright coverage. Step 6 adds a Pack publication catalog and verifier so the accepted example Pack has immutable schema/ID/version/hash metadata before broader distribution. Step 7 adds persisted gamification projections for badge awards, mission progress and mission status-change audit events while keeping XP/review/mistake/mastery rules authoritative. Step 8 accepts ADR 0016 for conflict-safe full user-state restore replay policy. Step 9 implements the restore provenance schema foundation and a blocked `user_state_dry_run` plan in restore preview. Step 10 exposes that dry-run plan in `/exports` with product UI coverage. Step 11 moves the central guard to the Next.js 16 `src/proxy.ts` convention and applies nonce-bearing CSP to runtime responses. Step 12 authenticated production walkthrough confirms most protected pages load, but `/exports` and `/achievements` fail with production Server Components render errors until Neon production migrations are explicitly approved and applied; append-only user-state replay/merge remains blocked until a future explicit apply mode is approved and implemented. Step 13 UI alignment is implemented, validated and pushed as commit `81f4ce3`: the app shell now uses stronger window chrome, route-aware navigation, boxed sections, differentiated surfaces and fixed sidebar/terminal visual issues. Step 14 generation modes are implemented locally through 14.8, including Manual and DeepSeek generation through the same validation/preview/import pipeline. Step 15 has started locally: 15.0 through 15.5 simplify first-run navigation, add empty-catalog guidance, move Pack activation before generation, recompose lessons as theory-first study surfaces and define scoped product-area accents that reduce the previous yellow dominance.

## Agent operating mode

`HIGH AUTONOMY WITH REPOSITORY GUARDRAILS`

Codex may progress through approved V1 roadmap phases without routine user confirmation, provided each phase gate passes and no stop condition in `AUTONOMY.md` applies.

## Implemented in Phase 1

- Minimal content/user-state Drizzle schema and generated migration for the vertical slice.
- Zod Track Pack validation, semantic validation, deterministic hashing and idempotent/conflict-aware import service.
- Drizzle-backed import repository tested against a migrated PGlite database.
- Disposable `memory://local` repository harness for Playwright/UI validation when no PostgreSQL service is available.
- Imported track, lesson and activity browsing routes.
- QuickJS child-process JavaScript runtime adapter with timeout/output limits.

- Activity panel with editable code, RUN, SUBMIT SOLUTION, terminal output and test results.
- History route showing submitted activity events.
- ADR 0011 for the initial QuickJS runtime decision.

## Implemented in Phase 2

- Concept detail route at `/concepts/[conceptId]`.
- Catalog repository concept read model with imported lesson/activity relationships.
- Lesson concept links to concept pages.
- Explicit placeholder copy separating current progress from future deterministic mastery/review.
- Drizzle/PGlite integration test and Playwright coverage for concept navigation.

- Safe invalid/unsupported block surfaces that do not execute arbitrary imported UI payloads.
- Typed activity registry for code activity config parsing and rendering.
- Persisted latest Attempt feedback read model with stdout/stderr and test results.
- Activity panel initializes from the latest persisted Attempt after page reload while preserving RUN versus SUBMIT SOLUTION semantics.
- Lesson and track progress summaries derived from append-only Attempt evidence.
- Progress UI explicitly separates navigation/completion from future deterministic concept mastery.

## Implemented in Phase 3

- JavaScript runtime contract metadata with runtime version, timeout/output limits and blocked capability expectations.
- Runtime tests covering stdout, stderr, runtime errors, timeout, output limits and blocked DOM/network/process/window access.
- Activity feedback UI that separates runtime status/contract metadata, STDOUT, STDERR and automated test summaries.
- Display-only source diff from immutable submitted Attempt source against starter code.
- Debug activity type registered through the activity registry and example Track Pack fixture.
- RUN/SUBMIT boundaries preserved for both code and debug activities.

## Implemented in Phase 4

- Append-only `concept_evidence` table and ADR 0012 for concept-scoped evidence.
- SUBMIT writes concept evidence in the same transaction as Attempt creation.
- Deterministic `mastery.v1` policy with explainable concept page output.
- `review_schedules` projection and `review.v1` interval policy.
- `/review` page plus review completion API/action that appends delayed-review evidence and `review_completed` StudyEvent.
- `mistakes` table, categorization rules, active/resolved state and `/mistakes` page.
- Deterministic Today recommendations ordered by due review, active mistake and catalog continuation.

## Implemented in Phase 5

- Optional `project_contexts` with joins to imported `concepts` and `activities`.
- `/projects` page that keeps project flow optional and reports linked concept/activity counts.
- Append-only `xp_transactions` ledger.
- First successful `SUBMIT SOLUTION` awards XP once per activity; `RUN` awards nothing and records no attempt.
- `/progress` page with total XP and transaction history.
- Deterministic rank, badge and mission read models displayed on `/achievements`.
- `/knowledge-map` page with a complete list-first fallback for imported concept relationships.
- Today recommendations include project application suggestions after review, mistake and catalog continuation priorities.

## Implemented in Step 7

- `badge_awards` table records earned badges once per owner with criteria snapshot and deterministic source.
- `mission_progress` table stores current mission status, completion timestamp and criteria snapshot.
- `mission_progress_events` appends mission status-change audit records.
- `/achievements` surfaces persisted badge/progress timestamps when available.
- Export snapshots include gamification projection data; restore V1 still skips gamification replay with the other user-state categories.

## Implemented in Step 8

- ADR 0016 defines the full user-state restore replay policy.
- Future restore now has explicit modes: current `pack_manifest_apply`, required `user_state_dry_run` and blocked future `user_state_apply`.
- Policy defines restore provenance ledger requirements, idempotency identity, append-only replay categories, projection rebuild rules, apply ordering and blocking conflicts.
- Import/export docs now state that attempts, XP, history, mistakes, reviews and gamification projections must not be replayed automatically by the V1 restore endpoint.

## Implemented in Step 9

- `restore_provenance` table foundation records source export fingerprint, source record identity, local record identity and payload hash for future idempotent replay.
- Shared canonical JSON hashing now supports both Track Pack content hashes and Backup fingerprints.
- Restore preview includes `know-os.user-state-restore-dry-run.v1` with category plans, blockers, warnings and `applyEnabled=false`.
- Unit coverage asserts stable Backup fingerprinting and blocked user-state replay planning.

## Implemented in Step 10

- `/exports` now includes a restore preview panel for Backup JSON.
- The panel posts to `/api/restore/preview` and displays the blocked `user_state_dry_run` summary, source fingerprint, category plans and blockers.
- No apply action exists for attempts, XP, history, mistakes, reviews or gamification projections.
- Component and contract coverage verify the UI readout and missing Pack manifest blocker behavior.

## Implemented in Step 11

- Central auth/session and runtime header guard now lives in `src/proxy.ts`, matching the Next.js 16 file convention for this `src/app` layout.
- Runtime responses receive a per-request CSP nonce and `x-nonce` request header for dynamic rendering.
- Production `script-src` no longer includes `unsafe-inline` or `unsafe-eval`; local development keeps `unsafe-eval` only for the Next.js dev server.
- Unit and Playwright coverage assert nonce-bearing CSP behavior and preserved Google OAuth origins.

## Step 12 production walkthrough

- Authenticated Chrome session reached the protected production app.
- `/`, `/tracks`, `/tracks/javascript`, `/lessons/js-fundamentals-001`, `/import`, `/progress` and `/knowledge-map` loaded without visible page errors.
- `/exports` and `/achievements` failed with production Server Components render errors.
- Production CSP readback confirms the live deployment is already serving nonce-bearing CSP from Step 11.
- Likely repair: apply checked-in migrations `0007_icy_vengeance.sql` and `0008_pale_shiver_man.sql` to Neon production with `pnpm db:migrate`.
- Stop condition: running production Neon migrations is an external database schema write and requires explicit user confirmation.

## Step 13 UI alignment

- Shared app chrome now uses the technical-brutalist window direction from the design references: signal topbar, bordered workspace frame, stronger sidebar and explicit main surface.
- Primary navigation is route-aware through `src/components/layout/primary-nav.tsx`, so the current route is highlighted instead of keeping `Fundação` active everywhere.
- Shared page primitives now create clearer hierarchy: foundation headers, boxed module sections, bordered record rows, differentiated progress/import/restore summaries and stronger auth status blocks.
- Playwright E2E harness now forces local no-OAuth mode with a disposable test secret so `.env.local` production OAuth values do not redirect local UI tests to sign-in.
- Local screenshots were captured under `test-results/ui-alignment/` for Today desktop, Import desktop, Lesson desktop and Progress mobile.
- Checkpoint and push: `81f4ce3 Align app UI with design system`.

## Step 14 generation modes and DeepSeek provider

- Step 14 introduces first-release generation with two modes: Manual Copy and Paste, and Direct AI Generation with DeepSeek.
- Both modes must share the same normalized `GenerationSpec`, prompt compiler, JSON parser, Pack validator, business validator, preview/diff and atomic importer.
- Implemented 14.0 orientation: generated output targets `caderno.lesson.v1`, but raw model/manual JSON cannot import until the shared validation/preview/import pipeline exists.
- Implemented 14.1 contracts/environment: `GenerationSpec`, full `GenerationStatus` vocabulary, provider request/result/error contracts, prompt compiler, raw JSON parser, `server-only` DeepSeek readiness config and env defaults.
- Implemented 14.2 persistence foundation: `generation_jobs` table, Drizzle and memory repositories, status timeline, compiled prompt/spec storage, provider usage storage and migration `0009_volatile_captain_britain.sql`.
- Implemented 14.3 Lesson Pack validation: `caderno.lesson.v1` parser, semantic validation, generated-output validation and malformed/Markdown blocking before preview or import.
- Implemented 14.4 Manual Copy/Paste flow on `/import`: Configure -> Compile Prompt -> Copy Prompt -> Paste AI JSON -> Validate -> Preview -> Import, with `waiting_external_response` job persistence and import through a reconstructed validated Track Pack boundary.
- Implemented 14.5 DeepSeek adapter: server-only provider, OpenAI-compatible JSON request, `response_format: { type: "json_object" }`, one retry for empty/transient/timeout responses, non-retry auth/balance/rate failures, `/api/generation/deepseek/generate` and shared generated-output validation before preview.
- Implemented 14.6 usage/cost estimates: versioned DeepSeek pricing config `deepseek-api-pricing-2026-07-31`, provider-side USD estimate from input/output/cache-hit usage, persisted `pricingVersion` metadata and a DeepSeek preview callout labeled as estimated cost.
- Implemented 14.7 failure recovery UI: failed DeepSeek generation preserves a Manual fallback prompt for the same `GenerationSpec`, exposes Retry, Switch to Manual, Copy Prompt and View Technical Details, and limits technical details to sanitized status/error metadata.
- Implemented 14.8 validation gate and provider abstraction completion: `ManualGenerationProvider` now wraps the manual compile path beside `DeepSeekGenerationProvider`, route tests cover valid and invalid DeepSeek generated JSON before preview/import, and the local validation gate has passed.
- Manual flow must be complete: Configure -> Compile Prompt -> Copy Prompt -> Paste AI JSON -> Validate -> Preview -> Import, preserving a persisted `GenerationJob` with `waiting_external_response`.
- DeepSeek flow must be visible even when unconfigured; absent `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` shows `AI / DEEPSEEK` with `STATUS API NOT CONFIGURED`, disables direct generation only and allows switching to Manual without losing form data.
- Server env keys implemented: `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL`, `DEEPSEEK_DEFAULT_MODEL`, `DEEPSEEK_PRO_MODEL`; no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` secret exposure is allowed.
- Provider abstraction planned: `ManualGenerationProvider` and server-only `DeepSeekGenerationProvider`; app code must not import provider-specific API clients directly.
- DeepSeek model IDs are fixed by user instruction for this work: default `deepseek-v4-flash`, advanced `deepseek-v4-pro`; retired aliases `deepseek-chat` and `deepseek-reasoner` are prohibited.
- The implementation must add or confirm `caderno.lesson.v1` validation before importing generated output; raw model responses can never import directly.

## Step 15 first-run and visual routing

- Primary navigation is now reduced to the main study destinations: `Hoje`, `Aprender`, `Praticar`, `Progresso` and `Mais`; below desktop it uses a two-column grid instead of a clipped horizontal rail.
- Secondary routes remain reachable through `Mais`: import, history, mistakes, projects, knowledge map, exports and achievements.
- Empty-catalog surfaces now share a first-run callout that explains why study content is unavailable and routes the user to `/import` as the first activation path.
- `/import` presents existing Track Pack activation before lesson creation/generation, while Manual and DeepSeek generation remain available through the same validated preview/import path.
- Lesson pages now present theory first as `Aula`, then linked concepts as supporting understanding, then practice activities as evidence-generating work.
- Product-area accent roles are defined in design tokens/docs and applied as small bordered brutalist accents for import, learn, review, mistakes, progress and generation surfaces. Yellow remains the `signal` token for primary action/current/focus, not page decoration.
- `design-system/VISUAL_IDENTITY.md` now defines operational identity rules for the exact logo, lockup, clear space, minimum sizes, colors, typography, app usage and implementation checklist.
- Screenshot-backed responsive QA covered empty and imported states at 375, 390, 768 and 1440 px. The initial capture found clipped mobile navigation; the grid repair was captured again at 375 px for Today, Import, Tracks and Lesson.
- Focused component, full unit, full Playwright E2E, lint, typecheck, build and diff checks pass for this Step 15 increment.
- Remaining Step 15 work: review the local changes and create a checkpoint commit when the scope is approved.

## Implemented in Phase 6

- Track Pack import size limit, preview endpoint and content-hash conflict reporting.
- Explicit Backup, Progress and Teacher Context export contracts with category previews and privacy warnings.
- `/exports` portability surface.
- Backup restore preview and non-destructive Pack manifest application through `/api/restore/preview` and `/api/restore`.
- ADR 0014 documenting why append-only user-state replay/merge is not automatic in V1 restore.
- Accessibility and responsive audit documentation plus Playwright coverage for landmarks, headings, skip link and page overflow across implemented V1 routes.
- Baseline response security headers and Playwright header smoke coverage.
- Security audit and deployment preparation documents.
- ADR 0013 documenting the authentication/session stop condition before public deployment.

## Not implemented

```

Latest Step 4 real PostgreSQL validation results:

```text
pnpm exec vitest run tests/integration/real-postgres.test.ts — passed with 1 skipped file/test when the real-Postgres flag is absent; normal unit/integration suite does not access external PostgreSQL.
pnpm test:postgres — initially failed on Windows runner `spawn EINVAL`; fixed runner shell handling.
pnpm test:postgres — then failed on real PostgreSQL FK references from generated migrations qualifying `"public".*` while testing in a disposable schema; fixed the harness to rebind those FK references to the disposable schema at runtime.
pnpm test:postgres — passed, 1 test against configured real PostgreSQL URL from ignored local env; applied 7 migrations in `know_os_real_pg_*`, imported 1 track and 2 activities, verified RUN records 0 attempts, SUBMIT records 1 attempt and progress read models update.
pnpm typecheck — passed.
pnpm lint — passed.
pnpm test — passed, 29 files and 72 tests, plus 1 skipped real-Postgres file/test.

pnpm install after overrides — passed; lockfile updated.
pnpm security:audit — passed with no known production vulnerabilities.
full `pnpm audit --audit-level moderate` — still reports dev-only `eslint -> minimatch@3 -> brace-expansion`; forcing `brace-expansion@5` breaks ESLint, so `brace-expansion@1.1.18` remains pinned and documented.
pnpm lint — passed.
pnpm test — passed, 29 files and 72 tests, plus 1 skipped real-Postgres file/test.
pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/security-headers.spec.ts --project=chromium — passed, 1 test with CSP assertions.

Do not run `pnpm typecheck` concurrently with `pnpm build`; Next mutates generated `.next` types during build.

## Next milestone

Step 15 is ready for local review and checkpoint commit approval. Do not push, deploy or apply production Neon migrations without explicit confirmation.

## Risk register

- Browser code execution is isolated through the current QuickJS child-process adapter, but any broader runtime support needs a fresh threat review.
- Pack versioning must be finalized before public content distribution.
- Production authentication is configured for Google OAuth with e-mail allowlist; protected redirects and service-level production flow are validated, while authenticated browser walkthrough remains user-session dependent.
- Gamification must not distort mastery or reward empty activity.
- High autonomy must remain bounded to the repository and approved V1 scope.
- Local checkpoint commits are now available after Git initialization. External push still requires user confirmation.
- Playwright uses port `3210`; port `3000` was already serving another local app during validation.
- No real local PostgreSQL service is available outside `.env.local`; `pnpm test:postgres` validates the configured PostgreSQL service through a disposable schema and destructive production database operations remain out of scope.
- Production Neon schema appears behind checked-in migrations after Steps 7 and 9; `/exports` and `/achievements` fail until migrations are explicitly approved and applied.
- Step 14 must not request, print, persist or expose `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`; use `UNCONFIGURED` locally until the user adds the key to ignored server environment.
- Local migration `0009_volatile_captain_britain.sql` is generated for generation job persistence. Do not apply it to production Neon without explicit confirmation.
- Step 15.0 through 15.7 are implemented and validated locally with screenshot-backed responsive QA. Commit/push/deploy remain separate approval boundaries.
- Playwright uses `memory://local` because PGlite works for Vitest/Drizzle integration but cannot be bundled reliably inside the Next dev server.
- Backup restore applies Pack manifests only in V1. User-state replay/merge is intentionally blocked by ADR 0014 until a conflict-safe append-only restore policy exists.
- Full dev dependency audit has one residual `eslint -> minimatch@3 -> brace-expansion` advisory path; production dependency audit is clean and the compatible dev pin is documented until the ESLint/minimatch path can move safely.

## NEXT ACTION

Review the Step 15 local diff, then create a checkpoint commit if approved. Do not push, deploy or apply production Neon migrations without explicit confirmation.

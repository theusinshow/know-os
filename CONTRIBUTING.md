- `feat/<scope>`: new capability.
- `fix/<scope>`: defect correction.
- `refactor/<scope>`: behavior-preserving restructuring.
- `docs/<scope>`: documentation only.
- `chore/<scope>`: tooling or maintenance.

## Commits

fix: prevent duplicate lesson version import
docs: document mastery evidence

```

## Pull requests

Each PR should contain:

- problem and scope;
- design or architecture references;
- screenshots for visible changes;
- tests and commands run;
- migration or compatibility notes;
- remaining risks.

Do not combine unrelated architecture, product and styling changes in one PR.

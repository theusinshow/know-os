# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository specification are documented here.

The format follows Keep a Changelog principles. Product versions will follow Semantic Versioning once the application scaffold exists.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Phase 0 Next.js App Router scaffold with TypeScript strict mode and pinned pnpm dependencies.
- Tailwind CSS foundation and generated CSS custom properties from `design-system/design-tokens.json`.

- Imported track, lesson, code activity and history routes for the Phase 1 vertical slice.
- QuickJS child-process JavaScript runtime with timeout and output limits.

- Phase 2 concept detail page, concept read model, lesson concept links and concept navigation tests.
- Phase 2 lesson block renderer registry with safe renderers for initial block types and unsupported/invalid block states.
- Phase 2 activity registry for typed code activity parsing/rendering and persisted latest Attempt feedback after reload.
- Phase 2 lesson and track progress summaries derived from append-only Attempt evidence without implying concept mastery.
- Phase 3 JavaScript runtime contract metadata and coverage for timeout, output limits, runtime errors, stdout/stderr and blocked DOM/network/process access.
- Phase 3 programming activity feedback UI with separated runtime metadata, STDOUT, STDERR and test summary.
- Phase 3 display-only attempt diff generated from immutable submitted source against starter code.
- Phase 3 debug activity registry path and example fixture using the isolated JavaScript evaluator.
- Phase 3 verified Programming Lab gate covering runtime contract, terminal/test feedback, attempt diff and debug activity behavior.
- Phase 4 append-only concept evidence model with ADR 0012 and generated migration.
- Phase 4 deterministic `mastery.v1` concept policy with explainable concept-page output.
- Phase 4 deterministic `review.v1` scheduling, `/review` queue and review completion evidence/events.
- Phase 4 mistake categorization, active/resolved mistake state and `/mistakes` page.
- Phase 4 deterministic Today recommendations ordered by due review, active mistake and catalog continuation.
- Phase 5 optional project contexts with imported concept and activity links plus `/projects`.
- Phase 5 append-only XP ledger, first-pass SUBMIT awards and `/progress` audit surface.
- Phase 5 deterministic rank, badge and mission read models plus `/achievements`.
- Phase 5 accessible `/knowledge-map` list fallback for imported concept relationships.
- Phase 5 project-aware Today recommendations after due review, active mistake and catalog continuation.
- Phase 6 import hardening with request size limits, preview endpoint and same-version content-hash conflict reporting.
- Phase 6 export contracts for Backup, Progress and Teacher Context with category previews and privacy warnings.
- Phase 6 restore preview/application endpoints using non-destructive Pack manifest restore and ADR 0014 for user-state replay boundaries.
- Phase 6 `/exports` portability surface.
- Phase 6 accessibility and responsive audit coverage across implemented V1 routes.
- Phase 6 baseline security headers and E2E header smoke coverage.
- Phase 6 security audit, deployment preparation document and ADR 0013 for the production authentication/session stop condition.
- ADR 0015 selecting Vercel, Neon Postgres and Auth.js Google OAuth as the production preparation stack.
- Step 2.3 production environment contract for Auth.js Google OAuth and Neon/Vercel readiness placeholders.
- Step 2.4 Auth.js v5 foundation with Google provider route, readiness helpers and tests.
- Step 2.5 central auth middleware that protects private pages/APIs when Google OAuth is configured while preserving local no-OAuth development.
- Step 2.6 Neon/Vercel production runbook and `pnpm db:migrate` command for applying Drizzle migrations.
- Step 2.7 final local validation gate for production readiness.
- Production Auth.js `AUTH_TRUST_HOST` environment contract for Vercel proxy deployment.
- Custom Auth.js sign-in page at `/auth/signin` using the KNOW/OS Design System and Google account selection via `prompt=select_account`.
- Design-system motion pass for the app shell, sign-in surface and recurring content primitives, including Playwright coverage for normal and reduced-motion modes.
- Product import surface at `/import` with bundled example loading, paste/file JSON input, preview-before-apply behavior and E2E coverage.
- Production activation of the bundled JavaScript Track Pack on Neon, with service-level validation of catalog read, RUN, SUBMIT SOLUTION, progress, history and export availability.
- Guarded `pnpm test:postgres` validation against a real PostgreSQL engine using a disposable schema and migration-backed import/RUN/SUBMIT/progress smoke.
- Production dependency vulnerability audit via `pnpm security:audit`, patched pnpm overrides and documented dev-only audit residual for ESLint/minimatch/brace-expansion.
- Enforced CSP candidate in Next.js response headers with Playwright coverage for core directives and Google OAuth compatibility.
- Pack publication catalog and `pnpm packs:verify` hash/compatibility gate for accepted distributed Packs.
- Persisted gamification projections with `badge_awards`, `mission_progress`, mission status-change audit events, achievement timestamps and export coverage.
- Zod server-environment validation.
- Vitest, Testing Library and Playwright smoke coverage.
- GitHub Actions baseline CI and separate Playwright E2E workflow.
- Guarded autonomy protocol in `AUTONOMY.md`.
- Persistent autonomous phase progression and recovery rules.
- `PROMPT-CODEX-RESUME.md` for context/session interruption recovery.
- Explicit local-action authorization and external/destructive stop boundaries.
- Phase gates, checkpoint rules, verification logs and durable `NEXT ACTION` requirements.

### Changed

- `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `PLANS.md` and `PROJECT_STATUS.md` now describe the real Phase 0 scaffold and canonical commands.
- Playwright E2E now runs with a fresh owned serial server because the local `memory://local` harness is process-global.
- Production deployment status now reflects the live Vercel + Neon + Google OAuth path and remaining manual owner-login validation.
- Production Google OAuth environment values were re-applied in Vercel after a Google `invalid_client` response, then redeployed and smoke-tested without exposing secrets.
- App interaction states now consume approved motion tokens for short reveal, hover, active, focus-within and state feedback rather than rendering as fully static surfaces.
- Empty Today and Tracks states now route users to the import product surface instead of asking them to call an API endpoint manually.
- Initial Codex prompt now authorizes phase-by-phase V1 execution instead of stopping after Phase 0.
- `AGENTS.md`, `PLANS.md`, `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `README.md`, `START-HERE.md`, and roadmap now support high-autonomy execution with repository guardrails.

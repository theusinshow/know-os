# KNOW/OS — Guarded Autonomy Protocol

This file defines how Codex and other implementation agents may work with high autonomy in this repository.

## Operating mode

Default mode: **HIGH AUTONOMY WITH REPOSITORY GUARDRAILS**.

Once the user authorizes a build, change, fix, or roadmap execution task, the lead agent must continue through the in-scope work without asking for routine confirmation at every step.

Autonomy does not mean skipping planning, tests, documentation, security boundaries, or scope control.

## Authorized local actions

The lead agent may perform these actions without asking again when they are necessary and remain inside the repository and approved scope:

- read and search repository files;
- update `PLANS.md` and `PROJECT_STATUS.md`;
- create, edit, move, or remove in-scope project files;
- install or update compatible project dependencies when justified;
- run formatters, generators, migrations against disposable development data, linters, type checks, tests, builds, and local development commands;
- fix failures caused by the current task;
- refactor in-scope code when behavior is preserved and tests cover the change;
- create or update tests, fixtures, documentation, ADRs, and changelog entries;
- create local Git checkpoint commits when Git is initialized, identity is configured, the working tree is understood, and the phase gate passes;
- delegate independent read-only audits or isolated workstreams to subagents and integrate their results.

## Actions requiring user confirmation

Stop and ask before:

- pushing commits, opening or merging pull requests, deploying, publishing packages, or making any external write;
- purchasing services or creating paid resources;
- requesting, reading, transmitting, or changing real credentials or production secrets;
- destructive or irreversible actions involving non-disposable data;
- modifying files outside the repository or approved writable roots;
- materially expanding the approved product scope;
- implementing multi-user accounts, billing, marketplace features, or other explicitly deferred capabilities;
- overriding an approved ADR, Product specification, Design System rule, or security boundary when the conflict cannot be resolved within existing precedence rules.

## Autonomous execution loop

For every non-trivial task, repeat this loop until the current objective is complete or a stop condition is reached:

1. **Orient** — read `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, the current plan, relevant specifications, ADRs, and Design System rules.
2. **Plan** — convert the objective into small, ordered, file-level increments with acceptance criteria in `PLANS.md`.
3. **Implement** — complete the smallest coherent increment.
4. **Validate** — run the narrowest meaningful checks for that increment.
5. **Repair** — diagnose and fix failures before moving on; never leave a known regression behind merely to continue faster.
6. **Record** — update the verification log, decisions, documentation, and changelog when required.
7. **Checkpoint** — when a phase gate passes, create a local Git checkpoint if safe and available.
8. **Continue** — select the next incomplete increment or roadmap phase without asking the user what to do next when the answer is already defined by repository documents.
9. **Finalize** — run full acceptance checks and report exact results, risks, and the next planned milestone.

## Decision policy under ambiguity

When a decision is needed, use this order:

1. explicit user instruction;
2. `AGENTS.md` and this file;
3. approved product and scope documents;
4. accepted ADRs;
5. Design System precedence;
6. existing repository conventions;
7. the smallest reversible choice that satisfies current acceptance criteria.

If the choice is reversible, low-risk, in scope, and does not alter a public contract, choose it, document the assumption, and continue.

If the choice is durable and has meaningful tradeoffs, create an ADR. Do not stop merely because an ADR is needed.

## Phase autonomy

The lead agent is authorized to progress through the roadmap phase by phase.

A phase may begin automatically only when:

- the previous phase acceptance criteria pass;
- required checks have actually run;
- documentation and project status are current;
- no unresolved blocker compromises the next phase;
- the next phase remains inside the approved V1 scope.

Do not collapse several phases into one unstructured implementation. Each phase must have its own plan, verification log, and checkpoint.

## Recovery and resumption

The repository must remain resumable after context limits, process interruption, or a new Codex session.

Before ending any incomplete session, update:

- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` with the current phase and exact state;
- `PLANS.md` with completed and remaining increments;
- the verification log with commands and results;
- a clear `NEXT ACTION` entry.

A resumed agent must continue from those files instead of restarting discovery or asking the user to repeat prior decisions.

## Current repository note

Phase 0 discovered that this checkout currently has no `.git/` directory. Local checkpoint commits remain authorized when Git is initialized and identity is configured, but agents must not claim checkpoint creation while Git metadata is absent.

Phase 6 uses `DATABASE_URL=memory://local` for Playwright. That local repository is process-global inside the Next dev server, so E2E validation must remain serial until a real isolated test database harness replaces it.

## Stop conditions

Stop only when at least one condition is true:

- user confirmation is required by this policy;
- a material specification conflict has no safe precedence resolution;
- a required secret, external service, or permission is unavailable and no documented local substitute exists;
- repeated diagnostic attempts show that the environment cannot satisfy a required acceptance criterion;
- continuing would risk destructive data loss, security boundary violation, or substantial scope drift;
- all authorized objectives and acceptance criteria are complete.

When blocked, do not return a vague request for help. Report:

1. the exact blocker;
2. evidence and commands already tried;
3. the smallest decision or input required from the user;
4. safe options and their tradeoffs;
5. the preserved repository state and next action after resolution.

## Prohibited autonomy patterns

- Do not claim progress, tests, or builds that were not executed.
- Do not invent product requirements to keep working.
- Do not weaken tests, accessibility, sandboxing, validation, or security to make checks pass.
- Do not repeatedly ask for confirmation for normal local edits or test commands.
- Do not stop after merely writing a plan when implementation was authorized.
- Do not continue past the approved V1 scope merely because additional ideas seem useful.
- Do not push, deploy, publish, purchase, or expose data without explicit user approval.
